This is John LaGreco's Portfolio project that gets updated periodically. This portfolio uses HTML, JS/jQuery & CSS and is all about John LaGreco and his work history as well as his new coding projects. 

If you click on the "recent projects" bar, there is a list of his projects that are live on the internet that you can review and experience what he can do.
