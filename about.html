		<p class="para3">For 8 years of my life I lived in Telluride Colorado. During these years of my 20s, I learned to snowboard. It became my passion and I would get over a 100 days on the mountain in one season. I accomplished this 3 years in a row. My style was more free-style than giant slalom carving. I enjoyed learning how to do arial tricks as well as deep powder riding. I embraced the culture and wore it on my sleve. Busting airs, rail sliding and 360s were my patented moves. I worked in the bars at night so that I could ride all day, well...we started at the crack of Noon.</p>
