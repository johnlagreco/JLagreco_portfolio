		<h2>All about me...</h2>

		<p class="para1">I've been in the IT field for over 10 years. My concentration has been network installation and support as well as help desk, troubleshooting and net admin responsibilities. Many of my IT projects have been challenging such as the photo to the left. Here I was just told to make the cabinet neat and organized. I would not have been able to accomplish this without being resourceful and tenacious enough to complete the job. The before and after photo is evidence of this type of determination.</p>

		<p class="para1">This is my Lorem Ipsum content. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My content is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. My content, without me, is useless. Without my content, I am useless. I must type my content true. My content is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its box model, its padding, its borders, its divs and its margins. I will keep my content clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will...It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. My content, without me, is useless. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. Lorem Ipsum.</p>

		<p class="para2">I have recently completed an intensive course to expand my IT skills by learning to code at <a href="http://nycda.com" target="_new"><span style="color:blue"><b>The New York Code & Design Academy</b></span></a>. This course was exciting but very challenging. I have links to my recent projects located in the sidebar to the left. In one of my 1st projects ever, I loaded a photo that symbolizes the journey that I was about to embark on<a href="http://nycda.zone/lagreco766/practice_layout/" target="_new"><span style="color:blue">...<i>The Road.</i></span></a>

		<p class="p1">I grew up with my family in Brooklyn NY. Both my mother and father's family are from there, as well as all of my grandparents. During my high school years, we moved to Connecticut. After those years, I attended Syracuse University where I received a BA in liberal arts.
		<br><br>After graduating from college, I took some time to search for a direction and have some fun. I decided to travel west and reside in a Colorado resort town known as Telluride. After some years of snowboarding, I moved back to NYC where I met my wife Beth. Beth and I  loved exploring the NY culture and nightlife before we eventually got married. A year later we had a beautiful daughter and named her Madeline after my late mother. My daughter is my life and nothing makes me happier than her.<button id="mad">SEE MADELINE</button></p>
