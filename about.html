		<p class="para1">I've been in the IT field for over 10 years. My concentration has been network installation and support as well as help desk and other network administration. Many of my projects in this area of IT have been challenging such as the photo to the left. Here I was just told to make the cabinet neat and organized. I would not have been able to tackle this without being resourceful and tenacious enough to get the job done. The before and after is evidence of this type of determination.</p>

		<p class="para1">This is my Lorem Ipsum content. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My content is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. My content, without me, is useless. Without my content, I am useless. I must type my content true. My content is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its box model, its padding, its borders, its divs and its margins. I will keep my content clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will...It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. My content, without me, is useless. Thus, I will learn it as a brother.</p>

		<p class="p1">I grew up with my family in Brooklyn NY. Both my mother and father's family are from there as well as all of my grandparents. During my high school years, we moved to Connecticut. After those years, I attended Syracuse University where I received a BA in liberal arts.
		<br><br>When I graduated from college I was ready to take some time to search for a direction and to have fun. I decided to travel west and reside in a Colorado resort town known as Telluride. After many years of snowbaording, I moved back to NYC where I met my wife Beth. Beth and I spent a couple of years exploring the NY nightlife before we got married. One year after we got married, we had a daughter and named her Madeline after my late mother. My daughter is my life and nothing makes me happier than her.<button id="mad">SEE MADELINE</button></p>
