		<p class="para1">I've been in the IT field for over 10 years. My concentration has been network installation and support as well as help desk, troubleshooting and net admin responsibilities. Many of my IT projects have been challenging such as the photo to the left. Here I was just told to make the cabinet neat and organized. I would not have been able to accomplish this without being resourceful and tenacious enough to complete the job. The before and after photo is evidence of this type of determination.</p>

		<p class="p1">I grew up with my family in Brooklyn NY. Both my mother and father's family are from there, as well as all of my grandparents. During my high school years, we moved to Connecticut. After those years, I attended Syracuse University where I received a BA in liberal arts.
		<br><br>After graduating from college, I took some time to search for a direction and have some fun. I decided to travel west and reside in a Colorado resort town known as Telluride. After some years of snowboarding, I moved back to NYC where I met my wife Beth. Beth and I  loved exploring the NY culture and nightlife before we eventually got married. A year later we had a beautiful daughter and named her Madeline after my late mother. My daughter is my life and nothing makes me happier than her.<button id="mad">SEE MADELINE</button></p> -->
